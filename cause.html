				<p id="paragraph1">For the Collapse of the Soviet Union, two categories of theories existed -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism">Structuralist</a> and <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9%E8%88%87%E8%93%84%E6%84%8F%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9%E7%9A%84%E7%88%AD%E8%AB%96">Intentionalist</a>. Intentionalists claimed that the Soviet collapse was not inevitable and resulted from the policies and decisions of some leaders. In contrast, the Structuralists view that Soviet Collapse was an outcome of deeply rooted structural issues which they called "time-bomb". </p>
				<p id="paragraph2">Some Intentionalists attribute the Collapse to Mikhail Gorbachev - the eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union. They pointed out that the two policies that Gorbachev published - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika">Perestroika</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demokratizatsiya_(Soviet_Union)">Demokratizatsiya</a> have only adverse effects. The Perestroika allows the company to be partially personalized. However, it failed because it doesn't fully implement while this new policy takes time to develop. However, the old system breaks down before the new system work, which leads USSR's economy into chaos. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">GDP</a> and oil price which dropped all the way from $88 to $26 reflect that. Another policy Demokratizatsiya allows the introduction of multi-candidate though not multipartyâ€”elections for the local Communist Party, which eventually made other republics struggle harder to get rid off the USSR.  </p>
				<p id="paragraph3">Some other Intentionalsits contended that Soviet elites were responsible for the collapse by promoting both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism">nationalism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">capitalism</a> from which they could personally benefit. Also, Gorbachev had admitted that some leaders' misconducts in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">Chernobyl nuclear accident</a> have considerably affected the credit of the USSR government. </p>

					<p id="paragraph4">On the contrary, the structuralists attributed the Collapse to the flaws of the USSR. They had mentioned a few reasons, like the advance of capitalism, ethnic problem, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism">Stalin's policies</a>. </p>
					<p id="paragraph5">Firstly, compared to capitalism, communism has a poor distribution model. Their industry mainly focuses on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_industry">heavy industry</a>, so since daily supplies were rationing regularly, people in smaller cities usually lack daily supplies. Although they could buy these supplies in a private store, the price was usually 2 to 3 times higher than state-owned store. This perfectly reflects on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_political_jokes">Soviet Jokes</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
					<p id="paragraph6">Also, although USSR tried to assimilate other non-Russian communities to give up their culture and language(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification">Russification</a>), other communities were still strengthened by policies like the indigenization of leaders. Eventually, this aid the independence of other nations inside the USSR. </p>
					<p id="paragraph7">Third, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism">Stalin's structure</a> that was set up before 1940 also contributed to the Collapse. Stalin's structure neglected individual interest(except for Stalin himself) like purged the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak">kulaks</a> by taking off their wealth. And the <i>focus on heavy industry production pattern</i> that have been aforementioned was also set up by Stalin. </p>

A famous Soviet Joke: Outside the Lubyanka (KGB headquarters) building in Soviet Moscow.<br>"No soap, no batteries, no socks..." a man said to himself as he walked. Another man who appeared to be in plain clothes came by and whispered to him: Comrade citizen, if you do this again against our great communist country, I'll hit you on the head with the handle of my pistol! <br>The man looked at the plainclothes policeman and continued to soliloquise: Look, there are even no bullets...</i></p>
